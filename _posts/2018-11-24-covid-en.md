The health and safety of our loved ones is our foremost concern.
We ask that all of our friends and family collaborate with us so that we can celebrate important traditions and commemorate this day as safely as possible, recognizing that some of our guests may have underlying health conditions.

We are monitoring guidance from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/guidance.html) and will update our plans as this guidance changes.
We will do what is "recommended" even if we are legally _allowed_ to expose our guests to additional risks.

Here are some things you can do to help us keep everyone safe.

- Get vaccinated. The vaccines approved for use in the US reduce transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Others are safer around you if you have been vaccinated.
- Wear a mask, especially when indoors.
- Maintain physical distancing.
- Quarantine after travel, particularly if you have not been vaccinated.
