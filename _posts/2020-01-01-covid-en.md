The global COVID-19 pandemic has deeply touched our lives and our families, and we want to take every possible precaution to ensure the health and safety of our loved ones.

We are monitoring recommendations from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/guidance.html) and the [State of Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/coronavirus) and will update the information below as this guidance changes.
We ask that all of our friends and family collaborate with us to celebrate this day with health and safety in mind.

## What we are doing to keep you safe

- Our reception will be held in a covered outdoor space to maximize ventilation. (However, cooled indoor space is adjacent.)
- In-person attendance will be limited.
- Seating will be chosen to limit the number of households at each table.
- We are reaching out to guests, especially those out of town, to check in regarding COVID-19 safety plans.

## What we ask of you to keep others safe

- Get vaccinated. The vaccines approved for use in the US reduce transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Others are safer around you if you have been vaccinated. If you would like help scheduling an appointment, please contact Mari or James.
- Wear a mask to cover your nose and mouth, especially when you are indoors.
- Maintain physical distancing and practice hand washing.
- The CDC recommends that travelers who have not been vaccinated self-quarantine for at least 7 days. Please see [CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html) and [Connecticut guidance](https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/Travel) for details.
