The global COVID-19 pandemic has deeply touched our lives and our families, and we want to take every possible precaution to ensure the health and safety of our loved ones.
Although [reported cases in Connecticut remain low](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/connecticut-covid-cases.html), the delta variant demands our attention and precaution.

We are monitoring recommendations from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/guidance.html) and the [State of Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/coronavirus) and will update the information below as this guidance changes.
We ask that all of our friends and family collaborate with us to celebrate this day with health and safety in mind.

## What we are doing to keep you safe

1. Our reception will be held in a covered outdoor space to maximize ventilation. (However, cooled indoor space is adjacent.)
1. In-person attendance will be limited.
1. Seating will be chosen to limit the number of households at each table.
1. We are asking guests who are not vaccinated to obtain a COVID-19 test within approximately 72 hours of the wedding. Please ask Mari or James for help scheduling a test if you would like assistance.
1. We are asking guests to wear masks indoors.

## What we ask of you to keep others safe

1. Get vaccinated. The vaccines approved for use in the US reduce transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Others are safer around you if you have been vaccinated. If you would like help scheduling an appointment, please contact Mari or James.
1. Wear a mask to cover your nose and mouth when you are indoors. We are asking guests to *wear a mask when indoors at St. Rose Church and when going through the buffet line at Cascade.*
1. Maintain physical distancing and practice hand washing.
1. The CDC recommends that travelers who have not been vaccinated self-quarantine for at least 7 days. Please see [CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html) and [Connecticut guidance](https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/Travel) for details.
