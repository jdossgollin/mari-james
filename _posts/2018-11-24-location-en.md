Our ceremony and receiption will be held in and around New Haven, CT, where we both grew up.
Mark July 24, 2021 on your calendar!

We are of course paying attention to the global COVID-19 pandemic.
Although no one can know the future, we hope to be able to safely celebrate with our friends and families.
We will keep you updated as we learn more.
