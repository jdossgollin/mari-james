Our ceremony and receiption will be held in and around New Haven, CT, where we both grew up.
Mark July 24, 2021 on your calendar!

We are of course paying attention to the global COVID-19 pandemic.
We hope to celebrate with our friends and families but will adapt to ensure the safety of all our loved ones.
We will keep you updated as we learn more.
